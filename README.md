# Bladder Cancer Prediction

# Project Overview
Bladder cancer is a significant health concern worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in effective treatment and prognosis. This project uses machine learning techniques to classify bladder cancer cases based on [specify data features briefly if known, e.g., clinical data, imaging, biomarkers].

# Features
1. Data preprocessing and feature engineering
2. Model training and evaluation
3. Achieved 90% accuracy on training data
4. Analysis of overfitting and suggestions for improvement

# Known Issues and Future Work
Overfitting: The current model shows high accuracy on training data.

# Future improvements may include:
1.Using cross-validation
2.Applying regularization techniques
3.Experimenting with more robust models (e.g., ensemble methods, deep learning)
4.Expanding the dataset for better generalization
